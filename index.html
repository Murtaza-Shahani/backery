            OUR STORY </u>
          </SPAN>
          <BR>
          Rains Bakery was founded in 1995 by Kira Weston, a passionate baker with a love of all things sweet. Kira started the bakery out of her home kitchen, and quickly gained a reputation for her delicious pastries and breads.

In 2000, Kira moved the bakery to its current location in downtown Fort William. The bakery has since expanded to include a cafe, where customers can enjoy their pastries and coffee in a relaxing atmosphere.

Rains Bakery is now a beloved institution in Fort William, and it continues to be a family-owned and operated business
